# Dotfiles for various apps 
### This repository acts as a backup for my configurations that I've settled with as I continue to tinker with Linux distributions.
Also made this to hopefully learn how to use git in the terminal and learn about manual configuration. Configs were made on Arch (yes, I know I sound pretentious) to also learn about building from the down-up (first Arch install).

## Necessary configs for apps
**Kitty-conf** - for the terminal emulator kitty<br> 
**rofi** - Sweet-inspired(kinda) config for the launcher rofi<br>
